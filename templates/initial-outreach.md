## Notes on personalisation

The [bracketed items] must be filled in. But also:

- Reference something *specific* they've done - not just "your impressive background"
- Be honest about what the role involves
- Keep it short - under 150 words
- One clear ask (usually: a call)
- No attachments or links in first email
