# Follow-up email templates

Follow-ups should add value, not just "check in". Space them 5-7 days apart. Stop after 2-3 if no response.

## Follow-up 1: Gentle bump (5-7 days after initial)

**Subject:** Re: [original subject]

Hi [First Name],

Just bumping this in case it got buried. Happy to share more about what we're working on if helpful.

## Follow-up 2: Add value (7-10 days after follow-up 1)

**Subject:** Re: [original subject]

Hi [First Name],

Wanted to share [something relevant] - [a recent paper, news item, or development related to their work or the role]. Thought you might find it interesting regardless of whether the role is a fit.

The offer to chat still stands if you're curious.

## Follow-up 3: Final (7-10 days after follow-up 2)

**Subject:** Re: [original subject]

Hi [First Name],

I'll stop filling your inbox - but if the timing is ever better, feel free to reach out. I'd still be happy to tell you about what we're doing.

## After a call - they need time

**Subject:** Thanks for chatting

Hi [First Name],

Good to meet you today. I understand you want to [think it over / talk to partner / finish current project / etc.].

No rush - reach out whenever makes sense. Happy to answer questions in the meantime.

## Re-engagement (months later)

**Subject:** Checking in - [org] roles

Hi [First Name],

We spoke [timeframe] ago about [role type] roles. You mentioned the timing wasn't right then.

Wanted to check if anything has changed on your end. We're still hiring, and I think your background would be a good fit.

Open to reconnecting?

## After they decline

**Subject:** Re: [thread]

Thanks for letting me know, [First Name]. I appreciate you being direct.

If circumstances change, feel free to reach out. And if you know anyone who might be interested, I'd welcome an introduction.

Best,
[Your name]

## Notes

- Keep follow-ups shorter than initial outreach
- Don't be apologetic ("Sorry to bother you again")
- Don't guilt-trip ("I haven't heard back...")
- Add value when possible (relevant content, updates)
- Know when to stop - 3 unanswered emails is enough
