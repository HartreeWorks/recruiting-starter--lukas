# Lookup candidate

Research **$ARGUMENTS** (candidate name, optionally with company) and compile a summary useful for recruiting outreach.

## What to find

Search the web for:

1. **Current role** - Where they work, what they do, how long they've been there
2. **Background** - Previous roles, education, career trajectory
3. **Technical work** - Papers, projects, open source contributions, talks
4. **Online presence** - LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter/X, personal website
5. **Interests & angles** - What they seem to care about, potential connection points

## Output format

Present findings in this structure:

```
## [Name]

**Current:** [Role] at [Company] (since [date if known])

**Background:**
- [Previous role 1]
- [Previous role 2]
- [Education]

**Technical work:**
- [Notable paper/project 1]
- [Notable paper/project 2]

**Online:**
- LinkedIn: [url]
- GitHub: [url]
- Twitter: [url]
- Website: [url]

**Potential angles:**
- [Observation about their interests or work that could be relevant to our roles]
- [Another connection point]

**Notes:**
- [Anything else relevant - recent news, mutual connections, etc.]
```

## Guidelines

- Focus on information useful for personalising outreach
- Note specific projects or papers, not just "extensive research experience"
- Look for connection points to AI safety/security work
- If information is sparse, note what couldn't be found
- Don't make up information - only include what you can verify

## If Airtable is available

After researching, offer to create or update a candidate record in Airtable with the findings.
