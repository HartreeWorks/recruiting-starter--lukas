# Draft follow-up

Write a follow-up email for **$ARGUMENTS** (candidate name).

## Before drafting

1. **Check Airtable** (if available) - Find the candidate's current status, last contact date, and notes
2. **Determine follow-up type:**
   - No response to outreach → Gentle bump or add-value follow-up
   - After a call → Next steps email
   - After they asked for time → Check-in
   - Re-engagement → Months later reconnect
3. **Read templates** - Review `templates/follow-up.md` for the appropriate template

## Context needed

If Airtable isn't available, ask for:
- When was the last email sent?
- What was the last interaction?
- How many follow-ups have been sent?

## Guidelines

- **Add value** when possible - share something relevant, don't just "check in"
- **Keep it shorter** than the initial outreach
- **Don't apologise** for following up
- **Don't guilt-trip** ("I haven't heard back...")
- **Know when to stop** - 3 unanswered emails is usually enough

## Output format

```
**To:** [email]
**Subject:** Re: [original subject line]

---

[Email body]

---

**Context:**
- Follow-up #[number]
- Days since last contact: [X]
- [Any relevant notes]
```

## After drafting

Offer these options:
1. **Revise** - Make changes based on feedback
2. **Create Gmail draft** - If Gmail MCP is available
3. **Update Airtable** - Update "Last Contact" and add notes

## Stopping rules

Suggest stopping follow-ups if:
- 3 emails sent with no response
- They explicitly declined
- Email bounced
- Significant time has passed (>2 months without response)

For long-silent candidates, suggest the re-engagement template instead.
